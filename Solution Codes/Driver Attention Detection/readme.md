## Real-Time Eye Tracking for Driver Attention Monitoring

This application is designed to monitor drivers' attention during driving by achieving real-time eye tracking via a webcam feed. It uses computer vision techniques and OpenCV to precisely detect and continuously track eye movements and positions within live video streams.

### How to Run the Application

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed (e.g., OpenCV).

3. Run the application by executing the `Main_View_Qt.py` file.

4. Use the desktop application to start real-time eye tracking and monitor driver attention during your driving sessions.

### Purpose

The primary purpose of this application is to enhance road safety by detecting and alerting drivers when their attention wavers from the road. It offers a real-time solution for monitoring driver behavior, helping to reduce the risk of accidents.
